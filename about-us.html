        <div class="box-6">
            <p>The FFF program offers highly customisable, dynamic, and personalised meal plans. 
                These are created for each client based on their individual health and wellness goals, 
                whether it be for weight loss, muscle gain, or simply maintaining a balanced diet. 
                Customisations include options for special diets such as paleo, vegan, vegetarian, 
                pescatarian, high protein etc. Calorie intake levels can be adjusted as you progress 
                through the program.
            </p>
            <p>This tool goes beyond simply recommending meals by connecting you with local food 
                merchants that provide fresh, tasty, and nutritious meals. We have included detailed 
                and up to date dietary information on snacks, meals, and drinks from various restaurants 
                in your local area. Our clients are provided with the option to purchase these items 
                through our partnered third-party delivery services.
            </p>
            <p>Fitness plans are another beneficial service we provide for those wishing to incorporate 
                exercise in their weekly routine. These can be adjusted to suit every fitness level from 
                very beginner to advanced. We provide a range of exercises at varying intensities for you 
                to choose from depending on your own personal circumstances including; cardio, strength 
                building, balance building, endurance, flexibility, and mixed training.
            </p>
            <p>Our calendar feature helps you set personal goals to make meal and fitness tracking even 
                easier. It can be used to set daily, weekly and monthly targets as well as providing a 
                visual representation of your progress. By having a schedule to reference throughout the 
                program, we hope our clients will feel motivated and inspired to reach their full potential.
