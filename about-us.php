                These are created for each client based on their individual health and wellness goals,

                Customisations include options for special diets such as paleo, vegan, vegetarian, 
                pescatarian, high protein etc. Calorie intake levels can be adjusted as you progress 
                through the program.
            </p>
            <p>This tool goes beyond simply recommending meals by connecting you with local food 
                merchants that provide fresh, tasty, and nutritious meals. We have included detailed 
                and up to date dietary information on snacks, meals, and drinks from various restaurants 
                in your local area. Our clients are provided with the option to purchase these items 
                through our partnered third-party delivery services.
